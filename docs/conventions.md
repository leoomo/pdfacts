# Conventions

Status: draft. These become binding with milestone M1. Each one exists because
the alternative produced a wrong or unstable result in measurements on 109
files (104 official German forms, 474 pages, about one million glyphs).

## Coordinate spaces

| Space | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| user | PDF default user space of the page, as written in the file |
| display | the visible page: media box intersected with crop box, rotation applied, origin bottom left, y upwards |

Facts are stored in user space. `PageGeometry` provides the transform to display
space and back. A library that writes into the file needs user space; a viewer
overlay needs display space.

Reason: on rotated pages, mixing unrotated coordinates with the rotated page
size gave positions that did not match the rendering.

## Page boxes

The page bounding box is read with a call that resolves inheritance from the
page tree. `FPDFPage_GetMediaBox` does not resolve it;
`FPDF_GetPageBoundingBox` does.

`UserUnit` is read through QPDF. PDFium has no accessor for it. When it cannot
be read, the value is unknown, not 1.

## Glyph boxes

| Box | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| advance box | from the origin along the writing direction by the advance width; height from the font's ascent and descent |
| ink box | tight bounds of the glyph outline |

Height from the font's ascent and descent placed the top edge within 0.5 pt of
the reference for 98.6% of glyphs. The engine's own loose box reached 89.7%.

## Word and line boxes

The union of the advance boxes of the glyphs that are not white space. Leading
and trailing spaces do not extend a box.

Reason: PDFium omits about 12% of space glyphs, so a box that includes spaces
depends on which spaces the engine happened to keep.

## Writing direction

Taken from the glyph matrix. `FPDFText_GetCharAngle` has the opposite sign.

## Text

The raw characters are kept. Normalized text is provided next to them:

| Engine output | Normalized |
| --- | --- |
| U+0002 for a hyphen at the end of a line | U+002D, flagged as a line-end hyphen |
| a ligature expanded into several characters at one origin | kept as one cluster |

## Appearance streams

Path and image facts include what annotation and widget appearance streams
draw. Each fact states whether it came from page content or from an appearance.

Reason: without appearance streams only 54% of the check boxes in the corpus
were found.

## Fonts

Fonts installed on the host are ignored by default. Only fonts embedded in the
file and the engine's built-in substitutes are used.

Reason: 28 of 104 files gave different glyph facts on macOS and Linux. With
host fonts ignored, all 104 were identical on macOS arm64, Linux arm64 and
Linux x86_64.

## Object identity

An annotation is identified by page index and its index in the page's
annotation array. The object number comes from QPDF at the same index. PDFium
does not expose object numbers. The mapping held for all 7935 widgets in the
corpus.

## Three states

"Absent", "unsupported" and "unknown" are different answers. A check that could
not be carried out is unknown. It is never reported as absent.

## Digest

Coordinates are quantized before hashing. Unquantized floating-point values
differ between platforms at the fourth decimal place even with one and the
same engine.
